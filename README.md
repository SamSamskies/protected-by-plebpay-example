Example of a site that ensures a visitor has paid a specific PlebPay paywall to access the site.

You can make a paywall for any Strike user with PlebPay. The paywall doesn't even need to be for yourself. For example, you could make a paywall where every payment was donated straight to the Human Rights Foundation by going [here](https://www.plebpay.com/create/hrf). If you wanna make your own, you can start [here](https://www.plebpay.com/).
